# ticketsJava

TicketApp is a very simple Ticket system made in Java for Liferay Interview.

TO RUN IT:

1 - Download the repository

2 - Execute the "TicketApp.jar" file within a Console (cmd, f.e.). You need to have the Input files as well.

3 - When prompted, you just have to input a number in the console (referring to the input case) and press Enter.

4 - The app will show you the receipt.

AS TO HOW DID I TEST IT:

I started with the 3 input cases stated in the PDF. Before anything else, I made an schema of how I should build the app. 
Obviously, I tested a lot of functions during the development of the app, as it was necessary to know if each smaller function worked properly 
to avoid major problems later on.

I also tested with a few more Input files, to see if changing the quantity, price and/or the strings of the items would work properly.

As an example, the inputs "entrada5 and entrada6" are Incorrect inputs, such as not having a number of each item...

You can change the input files and text by yourself if you please.

Thank you.
